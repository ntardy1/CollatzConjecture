All code and files relevant to experiments involving the Collatz Conjecture (3n + 1)

The Collatz Conjecture is a famous mathematical problem/challenge that is named after the German Mathematician Lothar Collatz,
who proposed the idea in 1937.
It involves the idea of starting with some integral seed number, (eg. 1, 5, 23, etc).
If the seed number is odd, you multiply it by 3 and then add 1. (5 -> (3(5) + 1 -> 16)
Then if the resulting number is even it is divided by two, but if it is odd then it is again multiplied by 3 and increased by 1.
This process is repeated until the number falls into the 4-2-1 loop, where 1 -> 3(1) + 1 = 4.

Lothar Collatz proposed that all integral seed numbers would eventually fall into this 4-2-1 loop.

The original purpose of this project had been to run various experiments regarding the Collatz Conjecture (eg. Running intervals of seed numbers
to get their respective iterations, creating graphical representations for various seed number intervals to observe any patterns, etc)
